<h2 id="agfo">Agate Fossil Beds National Monument<a class="p" href="#agfo">&#182 </a></h2>
<p>The weather at Agate Fossil Beds changes with the season.  Summer can be very hot with highs in the upper 90's, sometimes 100 degrees or more.  In the winter the temperatures can plummet to -10 or below.  Winds can make it feel colder and dry you out in winter or summer.  During the summer thunderstorms can build in the afternoon and some become violent.  In the winter, you could experience blizzard conditions.</p><p>All that said, there is nothing more beautiful than a pleasant late spring day with the sun is warm and the breeze is refreshing or walking in a snow of huge quiet flakes.</p>

<h2 id="alag">Alagnak Wild River<a class="p" href="#alag">&#182 </a></h2>
<p>Weather in the Bristol Bay area tends to be cool, cloudy, and misty with frequent rain and wind. Day temperatures in the summer range between 50 and 60 degrees Fahrenheit while night temperatures may drop to 40 degrees Fahrenheit. The surface of the Alagnak freezes in the winter, but water continues to flow. Frozen overflow creates thin layers of dangerous ice which pose a hazard for those who attempt winter river travel. Whatever the season, weather conditions may prevent airplanes from flying in, so parties should be prepared for at least one extra day on the river. Wearing layers of clothing makes it easy to regulate your body temperature.</p>

<p>Summer temperatures in this part of Alaska average in the high 40s to low 50s degrees Fahrenheit, with most days overcast and wet. Coastal areas are often shrouded in fog and rain. Winds are frequent and even in summer these conditions can lead to hypothermia, the dangerous lowering of the body's core temperature. As symptoms progress it becomes increasingly difficult to respond to them. Be aware of this danger and know how to avoid and treat hypothermia. Wearing layers of clothing makes it easier to regulate your body temperature.</p>

<h2 id="band">Bandelier National Monument<a class="p" href="#band">&#182 </a></h2>
<p>SpringSpring is probably the most unpredictable season of the year. A day with clear blue skies and daytime temperatures in the 70's can be followed by a snow storm with wet heavy snow and daytime temperatures in the 40's. Even so, spring is a beautiful time to visit as it marks the start of the wildflower season and the return of many migratory species of birds.</p><p>SummerSummers start out warm and dry with June usually being the hottest month of the year. Days in July, August and September often end with thunderstorms that can drop heavy localized rain and are often accompanied by lightning. One should be aware of this when hiking as storms can come up very quickly, sometimes with little warning.</p><p>AutumnMany people would say that autumn is the most beautiful season. The weather is usually sunny with turquoise blue skies and warm (but not hot) days and cool nights. An early snow can bring a quick end to fall as early as late September.  A normal first snowfall in the area is around Halloween.</p><p>WinterWinter brings with it blankets of snow. Average yearly snowfall at the visitor center is 25". Snow and ice can close trails and the ladders to Alcove House so call the visitor center to get details. Although winter weather can make access to some sites difficult, snow can add a beauty all its own to the scenery.</p>

<h2 id="bibe">Big Bend National Park<a class="p" href="#bibe">&#182 </a></h2>
<p>Relative humidity is usually low. The rainy season extends from mid-June to October with locally heavy thunderstorms and some flash flooding. However, the water recedes rapidly and the rainy season can be a delightful time to visit the desert. Fall and spring are usually warm and pleasant. Summers are hot, although temperatures vary greatly between the desert floor and the Chisos Mountains; May and June are the hottest months. Afternoon and evening rains often cool the desert from July to October. Winters are generally mild, although periods of cold weather (including light snow) are possible. Winter visitors must prepare for a variety of conditions.</p><p>The table below is based on average temperatures at the Panther Junction Park Headquarters. Temperatures in the higher mountain areas vary about 5–10 degrees below those shown, while temperatures along the Rio Grande can be 5–10 degrees higher. Sunshine is abundant most of the year. Infrequent and brief periods of cloudy weather may occur during the winter months. While snow is rare and generally light, occasional cold fronts can bring temperatures well below freezing.</p>

Snowstorms in October are not unusual, yet there are also many sunny and pleasant autumn days during the month. From October to May temperatures fall below freezing nearly every night. The park typically experiences its coldest and snowiest periods from December through February. Spring storms in March and April can still produce heavy snowfall that may impact travel in the region.</p><p>In summer the days tend to be pleasant, with daytime highs in June typically in the high 60s to low 70s (F), high 70s to low 80s in July and August, while September is similar to June. The rainy season occurs in July and August with frequent, usually brief, afternoon thunderstorms which produce heavy rain and frequent lightning. If visiting during these months remember that lightning kills and "when thunder roars go indoors!"</p><p>Lightning is a year-round danger –especially during summer storms! When thunder roars, go indoors. Lightning is within 10 miles (16 km) and you need to seek the shelter of a building or your vehicle immediately. Click Here for more information.</p>

<h2 id="cabr">Cabrillo National Monument<a class="p" href="#cabr">&#182 </a></h2>
<p>Near Perfection Almost three million county residents can't be wrong:  it's the weather.  While many areas of the country are hibernating under blankets of snow or sweltering in muggy mid-summer humidity, San Diego's climate is generally sunny and mild year-round. Spring The Pacific Ocean has a strong influence on weather conditions.  Springtime visitors to Cabrillo National Monument should be prepared for cool, windy, and foggy conditions, even if it is sunny, hot, and dry further inland.  An overcast marine layer can develop near the coast at any time of year, but this phenomenon is most common during the late spring and early summer.  Locals call these times "May Gray" and "June Gloom."  Thinking of hitting San Diego's beaches to laze in the warmth of sun-baked sand?  You'll probably want to trade the swimsuit for a sweatshirt and pants, as cloudy skies dominate and temperatures rarely rise above 70 degrees.  The upside:  you can pack away the umbrellas, because there's little chance of rain. Summer Ahhhh, summer in San Diego.  Blissful visitors stroll the park, the air redolent with the scent of sunscreen.  The city enjoys temperatures in the 80s during July and August, but fog can roll in suddenly, resulting in a quick drop in temperature. Fall Following the rhythm of the seasons, San Diego begins winding down in autumn.  Rain is rare, skies are clear, and temperatures usually hover in the mid-70s.  Fall is also the time when Santa Anas hit the county.  These ferocious winds howl in from the desert to the east, bringing dramatic temperature increases (daytime highs can quickly rise into the 90s), hot, dry air, and virtually no humidity.  Startled yelps provide the park's autumn soundtrack, as visitors and staff endure recurrent static electric shocks when coming in contact with metal exhibits, car doors, or each other. Winter November through February is the rainy season here, with chilly weather fronts roaring down from the Gulf of Alaska, delivering sometimes torrential downpours and temperatures in the 50s and 60s.  Once storms move out, however, the views from Cabrillo are usually the best of the year:  the rain cleanses the air and makes for crystal-clear panoramas. What to Wear A well-prepared visitor to Cabrillo National Monument will dress in layers any time of year to accommodate changes in weather conditions, and will remember the sunscreen and hat for sunny days:  coastal sun can be bright, even on cold winter days.

<p>Occasional fog and storms in the summer may limit your view. Winter storms screen the lake up to 50% of the time.</p><p>Weather plays a dramatic role at Crater Lake National Park. Winter, especially, shapes the landscape; snow generally begins to accumulate each year in October and doesn't melt in most places until the following June. Summer weather is more predictable, with warm, dry days, blue skies, and cool nights. Nevertheless, there may be days even in August when the lake is completely obscured by clouds and fog. Visitors to Crater Lake National Park should be prepared for any kind of weather, any time of year.</p><p>Winter ConditionsFrom October to June, Crater Lake National Park is a snow-covered wilderness. November through April is assuredly snowy with poor visibility and fair to poor driving conditions, but wonderful skiing and snowshoeing opportunities. With snowfall still lingering on the ground in early July, winter defines Crater Lake National Park more than any other season.</p><p>Snowfall averages 533 inches (1,350 cm) annually, and by early spring, it is typical to have ten to fifteen feet (4 meters) of snow on the ground. While snowfall is common in the Cascade Mountains, Crater Lake National Park is one of the snowiest areas in the Northwest where regular records are kept. The National Park Service began recording weather information at Crater Lake National Park headquarters in 1926. The winter of 1932-1933 still holds the record for total snowfall in a single season, with 879 inches (2,230 cm). In 1950, Crater Lake set a state record for snowfall in a single calendar year, with 903 inches (2,294 cm).</p><p>The most snow ever recorded on the ground at Park Headquarters was 21 feet (6.4 meters), on April 3, 1983. Typical winter temperatures range from a high of about 35°F (2°C) to an overnight low around 19°F (-7°C).</p><p>Buildings are often buried by snow during Crater Lake winters.</p><p>The major weather patterns at Crater Lake National Park originate in the Pacific Ocean. Storm events originate in the north Pacific and build in strength and moisture content over the ocean. Wind patterns at these northerly latitudes move storms from the ocean to the Pacific Northwest. Over 100 inches (250 cm) of rain falls each year on the Oregon Coast. After crossing the Coast Range, storm clouds descend into the Rogue and Willamette Valleys, dropping about 30 inches (76 cm) of rain. As storms move eastward, the high mountains of the Cascade Range push the cool, moist air to elevations over 10,000 feet (3,000 meters) in many places. As the air rises, it cools further. Water vapor in the air condenses to form clouds, and snow crystals form within them. If there is enough moisture in the clouds, the snow begins to fall. If the temperature is warm enough, the snow melts before it reaches the ground and falls as rain. Crater Lake, like all of the Cascade Range, is shaped by its winter snowfall. If you visit the park in summer, try to imagine 16 feet (5 meters) of snow blanketing everything. Then envision spreading phlox covering the roadsides. Without the snow, there would be no phlox, no streams, and ultimately, no Crater Lake.</p><p>Summer ConditionsThe weather in May and June can vary from warm and sunny to snowy and foggy with poor lake visibility. Temperatures may be as high as 65°F (18°C) or as low as freezing.</p><p>October usually presents cool but sunny days and brings the start of winter snowfall by mid-month.</p><p>Summer thunderstorms occur from June through mid-September, bringing dramatic displays of lightning and high winds. Boat tours, guided walks, and evening programs may be canceled if lightning is present in the park.</p>

<h2 id="deva">Death Valley National Park<a class="p" href="#deva">&#182 </a></h2>
<p>Death Valley is famous as the hottest place on earth and driest place in North America. The world record highest air temperature of 134°F (57°C) was recorded at Furnace Creek on July 10, 1913. Summer temperatures often top 120°F (49°C) in the shade with overnight lows dipping into the 90s°F (mid-30s°C.) Average rainfall is less than 2 inches (5 cm), a fraction of what most deserts receive. Occasional thunderstorms, especially in late summer, can cause flash floods.In contrast to the extremes of summertime, winter and spring are very pleasant. Winter daytime temperatures are mild in the low elevations, with cool nights that only occasionally reach freezing. Higher elevations are cooler than the low valley. Temperatures drop 3 to 5°F (2 to 3°C) with every thousand vertical feet (approx. 300m). Sunny skies are the norm in Death Valley, but winter storms and summer monsoons can bring cloud cover and rain. Wind is common in the desert, especially in the spring. Dust storms can suddenly blow up with approaching cold fronts.  National Weather Service forecast for Death ValleyDeath Valley Morning ReportWhy is Death Valley's climate so extreme?Why so Dry?Winter storms moving inland from the Pacific Ocean must pass over mountain ranges to continue east. As the clouds rise up they cool and the moisture condenses to fall as rain or snow on the western side of the ranges. By the time the clouds reach the mountain's east side they no longer have as much available moisture, creating a dry "rainshadow". Four major mountain ranges lie between Death Valley and the ocean, each one adding to an increasingly drier rainshadow effect.Why so Hot?The depth and shape of Death Valley influence its summer temperatures. The valley is a long, narrow basin 282 feet (86 m) below sea level, yet is walled by high, steep mountain ranges. The clear, dry air and sparse plant cover allow sunlight to heat the desert surface. Heat radiates back from the rocks and soil, then becomes trapped in the valley's depths. Summer nights provide little relief as overnight lows may only dip into the 85°F to 95°F (30°C to 35°C) range. Heated air rises, yet is trapped by the high valley walls, is cooled and recycled back down to the valley floor. These pockets of descending air are only slightly cooler than the surrounding hot air. As they descend, they are compressed and heated even more by the low elevation air pressure. These moving masses of super heated air blow through the valley creating extreme high temperatures. How extreme is Death Valley's weather?Record TemperaturesThe hottest air temperature ever recorded in Death Valley (Furnace Creek) was 134°F (57°C) on July 10, 1913. During the heat wave that peaked with that record, five consecutive days reached 129° F (54°C) or above. Death Valley holds the record for the hottest place on earth.Oddly enough, 1913 was also the year that saw Death Valley's coldest temperature. On January 8, the temperature dropped to 15°F (-10°C) at Furnace Creek.Longest summersThe greatest number of consecutive days with a maximum temperature of 100° F or above was 154 days in the summer of 2001. The summer of 1996 had 40 days over 120° F, and 105 days over 110° F. The summer of 1917 had 43 consecutive days with a high temperature of 120° F or above.Dry as a boneNo rain was recorded in the years of 1929 and 1953. The driest stretch on record was only 0.64 inches (1.6cm) of rain over a 40-month period in 1931 to 1934.Weather data was compiled from park and National Weather Service record summaries for the years 1911 through 2007 for Furnace Creek in Death Valley, California.</p>

<p>Although summers are hot and humid, the high temperatures are tempered by frequent thunderstorms. The summer/fall wet season extends from about mid-May to November, with temperatures ranging into the low 90s (30 to 35 degrees Celsius). The majority of the year's average annual rainfall (nearly 60 inches, or 152 cm) falls during the wet season. Continental cold fronts generally cannot penetrate as far south as south Florida during the summer, so warmth and humidity build. Thunderstorms arise when warm, moist air masses combine with an unstable atmosphere. Thunderstorms can be as brief as a few minutes or as long as several hours. As cooler air glides inland from the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean, thunderstorms can erupt along sea-breeze fronts. At times, these thunderstorms can be an almost daily occurrence. Sometimes these storms move very slowly, enabling them to drop several inches of rain. The largest amounts of rainfall typically are associated with tropical storms and hurricanes.</p><p>The Dry Season Taylor Slough photographed during the winter dry season. The crusty material is periphyton, a complex mixture of algae, cyanobacteria, microbes, and detritus that forms the base of the Everglades food chain. During the summer wet season, Taylor Slough submerges and the periphyton rehydrates.</p><p>NPS photo by Sarah ZennerThe winter/spring dry season extends from about December to mid-May, with temperatures ranging from the low 50s to upper 70s (12 to 25 degrees Celsius) and low humidity. Continental weather fronts occasionally bring near-freezing temperatures to south Florida. Often-breezy winter weather conditions can create a wind chill factor that makes perceived temperatures feel considerably cooler than what the thermometer reads. South Florida receives only about one quarter of its average yearly rainfall during the winter dry season. From late fall through early spring, continental cold fronts periodically plunge southeastward through the state, sweeping away any warm, humid air. Cool, dry air stabilizes the atmosphere, suppressing any showers and thunderstorms. Any rain associated with these frontal passages typically arrives in the form of squall lines that sweep through so quickly that they have little opportunity to drop substantial amounts of rain.</p>

Rainy periods throughout the year. Wear comfortable sportswear. Walking shoes and insect repellant are recommended.</p><p>Thunderstorms & Lightning: When it rains in Savannah, it usually pours! Florida's thunderstorms are beautiful, powerful and potentially dangerous. The majority of Georgia's thunderstorms come in the summer months, chiefly during the afternoon. Formed by the combination of humid air and hot temperatures they create strong updrafts which form massive clouds filled with electrical and kinetic energy. Typically short-lived, they can drop several inches of rain in a short period of time.</p>

<p>Weather and Climate Glacier Bay has a maritime climate, heavily influenced by ocean currents. The result is mild winters and cool, moist summers near sea level. Summer visitors can expect highs between 50 and 60 degrees F (10 to 15 degrees C). Winter temperatures rarely drop into the single digits, with average nighttime lows of 25 to 40 degrees F (-2 to 5 degrees C). Bartlett Cove receives about 70 inches of precipitation annually. You may find yourself thinking it’s all coming down during your visit! Good rain gear is essential here. April, May and June are usually the driest months of the year. September and October tend to be the wettest.</p><p>Keep in mind, these are weather conditions at sea level. Up in the mountains, conditions are more severe with colder temperatures and precipitation that takes the form of snow. At any elevation, be sure and dress appropriately and be aware that the risk of hypothermia is present at any time of year. But do remember - it’s all that rain and snow falling year after year that creates the lush forests and magnificent glaciers we love to see!</p>

<h2 id="glac">Glacier National Park<a class="p" href="#glac">&#182 </a></h2>
<p>Glacier's weather is highly variable and can be extreme. Hikers setting out on a warm summer day, if they are careful, bring along raingear and lots of extra clothing. Just outside the park's eastern boundary, in Browning, Montana in 1916, the temperature dropped from plus 46 degrees F. to minus 56 degrees in 24 hours -- 100 degrees in a day! It is still an all-time world record.</p><p>In the driest corners of the park, along the northeast and northwest edges, rainfall averages 23 inches a year, while in the lowlands of the west side, about 30 inches of precipitation fall in the average year. As moist air is forced up to the elevations of the Divide, it loses its moisture and precipitation jumps to 100 inches or more in isolated mountain cirques. Snowfall settles to around a 16-foot average snowpack.  Early summer snow removal on the Going-to-the-Sun Road, which crosses the Continental Divide, is so spectacular it has become a spectator sport.</p><p>The east side of Glacier is in a rain shadow and gets less overall precipitation than the west. The dryness of the east side is also due to high winds. Downslope winds are often 50 mph or more, sometimes reaching 100 mph. Warm chinook ("snow-eater") winter winds regularly create a temporary spring, raising temperatures over 30 degrees in just minutes. If the cold Arctic air pools deep enough on the east side, spills over the top, and collides with Pacific moisture, raging blizzards can result. One dumped 44 inches of snow in a day.</p><p>U.S. Geological Survey scientists, stationed at Glacier, are doing landmark research on the effects of global climate change in this mountain ecosystem. Recent warming trends have shrunk the size and numbers of glaciers in the park. While precipitation changes are more difficult to predict than temperature, scientists expect to see more precipitation fall as rain with a warmng climate. This means snowpacks may not be as deep in the future. Because warmer global temperatures have the effect of "spinning up" evaporation and precipitation cycles, scientists also predict more rain to come as "events" as the planet surface heats up. Research in Glacier provides scientists with a natural laboratory to test these ideas.</p>

<p>ClimateLake Superior greatly ameliorates temperature extremes, slowing spring warming and the onset of winter. The coldest months average well below 0°C (32°F) and the warmer months about 22°C (70°F).</p><p>The average date of the last freezing temperature in spring is June 8, and the average first fall freeze is September 23; however, freezing can occur during any month. The freeze-free period, or growing season, averages 107 days annually.</p><p>The area is the second-most cloudy region of the United States, characterized by an annual mean cloud cover of 70 percent. Much of the cloudiness occurs in autumn and winter, and can be attributed to cool air flowing over Lake Superior being warmed along the shore and forming clouds. This condition also often results in rain, fog, and snow. Spring is relatively clear due the cold water surface of the lake.</p>

<h2 id="pinn">Pinnacles National Park<a class="p" href="#pinn">&#182 </a></h2>
<p>Pinnacles National Park has a Mediterranean climate with hot and dry summers, and mild winters with moderate precipitation. The park is several miles inland from the Pacific Ocean, without the moderating effects that coastal regions of California such as the San Francisco Bay Area experience. Hence, a wider variation in seasonal temperatures can be expected in the local area. On July or August day, daytime temperatures over 100° F are not uncommon, while overnight subfreezing winter temperatures are not uncommon.  Spring and fall are typically the most pleasant weather for hiking and visiting the park.</p><p>The steep hiking trails combined with the typically dry weather make it very important for park visitors to carry plenty of drinking water in any season. One of the most common incidents that park staff and volunteers respond to are hikers who have dehydration related emergencies. Many of the trails in the park are exposed to direct sun with little shade. Sun protection (hat, sunscreen, lightweight long-sleeve and long-pants) can make your trip much more enjoyable and safe.  In winter months, warm layers, and a light rain repellent jacket can help you stay warm and dry from rain and showers. In heavy rain events that produce flooding, be careful at stream crossings, and check with a ranger about trail conditions for hazardous areas such as the Balconies Cave Trail.</p>

<h2 id="redw">Redwood National and State Parks<a class="p" href="#redw">&#182 </a></h2>
<p>Oceanic influences ensure fairly constant year-round temperatures along California's redwood coast: mid-40s to low-60s°F. Winters are cool with considerable precipitation. From October through April, a high pressure area sitting atop the North Pacific drives a series of storms onshore, dumping the majority 60-80 inches of annual rain over the region.</p><p>In summer, the high pressure area migrates north, taking with it the heavy clouds and storms of winter. The California Current pulls warm surface water away from the coast, bringing deeper and colder water from the ocean's depths close to shore. Where cold ocean and dry land meet, moisture is created: a narrow band of fog seeps up deeply eroded river canyons, shrouding coast redwoods in life-sustaining moisture during the drier summer. Conditions inland are generally warmer and sunnier.</p>

<p>Summer days in July and August often reach the 70's or 80's and drop into the 40's at night. All temperatures given are in Fahrenheit.</p><p>Climate is a general term to express broad patterns. For example, Colorado's climate is sunny with warm summers and cold winters. Weather applies to specific movements of air masses, levels of precipitation, and temperature fluctuations at specific times of the year. The Continental Divide runs northwest to southeast through the center of the park atop the high peaks. This accounts for two distinct climate patterns - one typical of the east side near Estes Park and the other associated with the Grand Lake area on the park's west side. In recent years, park researchers have been tracking changes to the climate in the park.</p><p>Winter (December - March) Lower elevations on the east slope of Rocky Mountain National Park are usually free of deep snow. At higher elevations, arctic conditions prevail. Sudden blizzards, high winds, and deep snowpack are common. The west side of the park experiences more snow, less wind, and clear cold days during these months. Most high country overnight trips require gear suitable for -35 degrees or below. Skiing and snowshoeing conditions are best in January, February, and March.</p><p>Spring (April - May) Spring comes to the montane area - elevations 8,000' to 9,500' (2,438 - 2,895 m) - in late April, although snowfall is not uncommon at this time of year. Unpredictable weather alternates between warm and cold, wet and dry. In June, spring is just reaching the subalpine country - 9,500' to 11,500' (2,895 - 3,505 m), while summer is on the plains. Wildflowers begin blooming at lower elevations in late April or early May. Many trails are still snow-covered. In late May, Trail Ridge Road opens for the season.</p><p>Summer (June - August) On the alpine tundra -- 11,500' to 13,000' (3,505 - 3,962 m) wildflowers bloom from late June to early August. Afternoon thunderstorms and wind are normal patterns. Always be prepared for temperature drops of 10-20 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><p>Fall (September - November) September and October bring clear, crisp air, blue skies, and generally dry weather. An early snowstorm may occur. Aspen leaves start changing colors in mid-September. Elk mating season begins in September and continues through most of October.

<h2 id="wica">Wind Cave National Park<a class="p" href="#wica">&#182 </a></h2>
<p>The Black Hills are sometimes described as an island rising within a sea of grass. This sudden rise in elevation and the resulting slopes and exposures produce a much different climate than the surrounding plains. Wind Cave National Park lies on the southern tip of the "island" and, like the rest of the southern hills, has weather patterns that are greatly influenced by the Rocky Mountains to the west and the higher peaks of the northern Black Hills. Generally, the climate is semi-arid with mild winters and warm summers.</p><p>Climate and weather are not the same! Climate is a general term used to express broad patterns - for example, South Dakota's climate is sunny with warm summers and cold winters. Weather applies to specific movements of air masses, levels of precipitation, and temperature fluctuations at specific times of year--for example, today's weather is partly cloudy.</p><p>Wind Cave National Park and the rest of the southern Black Hills are much warmer and drier than the northern hills. Some residents call the area South Dakota’s “banana belt.” The banana belt exists because of two weather patterns. The first weather pattern occurs when warm, moist air traveling east from the Pacific Ocean reaches the Rocky Mountains. The mountains force the air to rise, causing it to cool. When the air cools, the water vapor in the clouds condenses and falls as rain or snow. Once the air reaches the other side of the mountains, it is considerably drier. The dry air begins to descend, and becomes warmer again. The warm winds created by the descending air masses are called Chinook winds. This warm, dry air continues east and brings warmer and drier weather to the southern Black Hills.</p><p>Winter(November - March)Snowfall averages 30 inches annually. January is usually the coldest month, but March often brings the most snow.</p><p>Spring(April and May)Occasional high winds can make for extra chilly weather. Consistent spring-like weather generally occurs in late April, but some snow is possible. May usually brings the most precipitation, about 3 inches.</p><p>Summer(June - August)Like May, June can be a rainy month. Severe thunderstorms are common in June and July and occasional in August.</p><p>Fall(September - October)Days are warm and nights comfortably cool. Snow is common in late fall.</p><p>September weather is often very pleasant with an average high of 78.4° F and an average low of 44.6° F. September is a little drier than the summer months.</p><p>March brings the warmest winter temperatures, but the most snow. The average high and low are 49.7° F and 21.4° F.

<p>Although the park contains some coastline, high mountains and icefields act as barriers to the ocean's moderating influence. The result is that with the exception of the coastal Yakutat area, Wrangell St. Elias has an interior continental climate (long, extremely cold winters, and short, warm, relatively dry summers). Remember that in any season, the weather can change quickly, so it is wise to pack clothing that can be layered, ready to peel off or add as conditions dictate.Yakutat: Each season has its advantages and disadvantages. Numerous storms usually accompanied by high winds occur during the spring, fall and winter. On average, Yakutat receives 151 inches of rain. June has the lowest average precipitation of any month with around seven inches of rain, while October has the heaviest monthly rainfall at around 24 inches. During the summer, the weather occasionally remains cloudless and delightful for days at a time. The average summer temperature is 53 F, with an average high temperature of 67 F. Though Yakutat receives an average of over 200 inches of snow each winter, the average low is a rather comfortable 26 F.What time of year should I visit the park?National Weather Service: Check out the latest weather forecast for Glennallen, AK.</p><p>SummerWildflowers and mosquitoes peak in June and July. Consider bringing a head-net. June and July are also the warmest months, with highs reaching near 80 on some days, but it can snow any month of the year in the highcountry. The prime backcountry season is June 20 to August 20 due to snow depths at higher elevations. Drizzling rains are not uncommon throughout the summer and, in general, rainfall increases in August and September, especially along the coast.FallAutumn arrives early;willows and aspens begin to change color by mid-August.

<h2 id="yuch">Yukon - Charley Rivers National Preserve<a class="p" href="#yuch">&#182 </a></h2>
<p>Yukon-Charley Rivers covers 2.5 million acres in eastern Interior Alaska. It is flanked to the north and northwest by the Brooks Range and to the southwest by the Alaska Range. The climate of the interior area between these two mountain ranges is generally classified as sub-arctic, with exceptionally cold winters, relatively warm summers, low annual precipitation, and generally high winds.</p><p>The elevational range of the preserve (600 to 6,000+ feet) produces local variations in weather and climate. Above timberline, at about 3,000 to 3,500 feet, the climate is generally classified as arctic with cooler summers, warmer winters (due to prevailing cold air inversions), heavier precipitation and increased winds, compared to the sub-arctic landscape below and within timberline.</p><p>Spring: The month of March, with its 12 hour long days, abundant sunshine, and sparse precipitation is thought by many local residents to be the finest month of the year. April brings thawing and mud and breakup of the Yukon River ice usually occurs in early May.</p><p>Summer: The Yukon-Charley Rivers area is one of the warmest sections of Alaska in the summer. Although daily highs average in the 60's to low 70's, a high of 97 has been recorded. Thundershower activity is common and, in some years, causes considerable forest fire activity. While daily lows average in the 40's, subfreezing temperatures can occur in any month, especially at higher elevations. The period of continuous daylight or twilight ends in late July and by the end of August, nights will have six or seven hours of darkness, allowing for a glimpse at the majestic northern lights.</p><p>Autumn: The transition from summer to winter is rapid. Peak fall colors occur in the high country in late August and by mid September, most aspens and birches have turned golden. Ice begins flowing in the Yukon River in late October, with freeze-up usually by mid-November.</p><p>Winter: Lasting from October to March, winter is arguably the dominant season. Temperatures of -50F or lower are normal during cold spells. Fortunately, winter winds are usually light, but when high pressure centers occur, winds may be from 15 to 40 miles per hour for days at a time. The desert-like Interior Alaska is not known for heavy snowfall as snow depths over two feet are uncommon. The short days of late December will have only about 6 hours of daylight and twilight combined.</p>

Favorable conditions prevail for hiking and canyoneering, but be sure to check the weather forecast, flash flood potential ratings, and the temperature of the river before exploring the park. Day and night temperatures can differ by over 30°F/17°C. Consider dressing in layers to prepare for changes in temperature.</p><p>WinterWinters in Zion National Park are cold and often wet. Temperatures can range from highs of 50-60°F during the day to lows well below freezing at night. Nearly half of the annual precipitation in Zion Canyon falls between the months of December and March. Roads are plowed, but trails may be closed due to snow and ice. After winter storms, snow typically disappears within a matter of hours at lower elevations. At higher elevations, the snow accumulates. As temperatures rise in spring, melting snow causes high water levels in the Virgin River and its tributaries.</p>
